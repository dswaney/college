.SYNOPSIS
    Deletes all user profiles under C:\Users except for Default, Public, MISAdmin, and other exclusions.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script enumerates all Win32_UserProfile instances whose LocalPath begins with C:\Users. 
    Any profile whose folder name is not in the exclusion list will be passed to Remove-CimInstance, 
    which calls Delete() on the underlying WMI object. It includes:
      • A check to ensure the script is running elevated.
      • An exclusion list: Default, Public, MISAdmin, dvswaney (and any others you add).
      • Error handling/logging for each deletion attempt.

.NOTES
    • Run this script as Administrator.
    • If a profile is in use or protected, removal will fail and be logged as a warning.
    • Adjust or expand the $ExcludedProfiles array to preserve additional profiles.
